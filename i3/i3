# ~/.i3/config

## configuration for the i3 window manager by Michael Fincham <michael@finch.am>
# recommended for use with i3 >= 4.8, and dunst >= 1.1.0 (to avoid a painful bug where dunst locks up if paused while displaying)
# 
# other packages used explicitly within:
#
# gnome-terminal
# gnome-settings-daemon
# redshift-gtk
# xscreensaver
# network-manager-gnome
# workrave
# volumeicon-alsa
# orage
# zim
# revelation (>= 0.4.14 because anything less has horrible security bugs)

## set up variables for later use

# make the otherwise useless "Windows" key activate i3 commands
set $mod Mod4

## window-specific configurations
# XXX there are likely some other windows which could be added here

# workrave's "rest break" windows should be floating but isn't by default
for_window [class="^Workrave$" title="^Rest break$"] floating enable

# keep this one terminal in the scratchpad
for_window [window_role="^scratchpad-terminal$"] move scratchpad

# XXX this is a bit of a hack but it's the quickest way to keep revelation's windows all in one place (otherwise the popups arrive in
# the active workspace which is annoying).
for_window [class="^Revelation$"] move container to workspace number 4

## startup programs

# pre-start dunst now to avoid something else claiming its role
exec --no-startup-id dunst

# start the `gnome-settings-daemon' as a quick shortcut to getting GTK etc ready, also enables laptop hotkeys
exec --no-startup-id gnome-settings-daemon

# fix key-mappings after starting gnome-settings-daemon
# XXX requires a sleep to make sure it runs after gnome-settings-daemon. this also doesn't survive a keyboard re-plug
exec --no-startup-id "sleep 10; xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap"

# start redshift and specify the location of Wellington to avoid privacy issues with Internet based lookup
exec --no-startup-id redshift-gtk -l 41.2889:174.7772 

# start the 'scratchpad' python REPL. will be put in to the i3 scratchpad automatically.
exec --no-startup-id "gnome-terminal --disable-factory --role=scratchpad-terminal -t 'Scratchpad' -x bash -c 'while true; do clear; ipython; done'"

# launch xscreensaver for use instead of i3lock. i3lock is OK, but on all my hardware it has bugs with DPMS whereas
# xscreensaver doesn't seem to.
exec --no-startup-id xscreensaver -no-splash

# do not start ubuntu's update-notifier by default due to potential privacy concerns.
# XXX enabling this is probably a good idea though :/
# exec --no-startup-id update-notifier

# start various other boring programs :)
exec --no-startup-id nm-applet
exec --no-startup-id workrave
exec --no-startup-id volumeicon
exec --no-startup-id orage
exec --no-startup-id zim

# replace the existing gnome keyring daemon with this one, telling it to turn everything on except GPG agent...
# exec --no-startup-id export $(gnome-keyring-daemon --replace --components=pkcs11,secrets,ssh)

# start gpg agent (makes setting timeouts etc simpler in the normal gpg-agent config)
# exec --no-startup-id export $(gpg-agent --daemon)

## configure `i3bar'

bar {
    status_command i3status
    # making the bar at least 12pt is required to make the notification area usable on my highest density LCD (~ 110 PPI)
    font pango:DejaVu Sans Mono 12
}

# the font used everywhere else, dmenu and dunst are set to match (though dmenu can only match the size by default and not the face)
font pango:DejaVu Sans Mono 10

## key bindings

# removed: the default movement keys using shifted-vim style, as I don't use it
# removed: the masochistic modal window resize stuff.

# XXX investigate terminals other than gnome-terminal

# focus the parent container. I never want to focus a child again with the keyboard, so removed that shortcut key.
bindsym $mod+a focus parent

# switch to workspace
bindsym $mod+1 workspace 1: Work

# two options for this: i3lock or xscreensaver.
#
# for i3lock:
# -n tells i3lock not to fork, so dunst is only un-paused when the screen unlocks
# -d uses DPMS to turn off the display while locked however this is buggy on my hardware (thus switching to xscreensaver) 
# bindsym $mod+l exec "notify-send DUNST_COMMAND_PAUSE; i3lock -u -c 000000 -t -n -d -i /home/fincham/windows.png; notify-send DUNST_COMMAND_RESUME"

# screensaver-command doesn't fork like i3lock does, so no special handling is required.
bindsym $mod+l exec "notify-send DUNST_COMMAND_PAUSE; xscreensaver-command -lock; notify-send DUNST_COMMAND_RESUME"

# set up "tabbing" between workspaces (more useful on the laptop where there are fewer things per workspace)
# XXX investigate $mod+capslock for previous workspace instead of shift+tab
bindsym $mod+Tab workspace next
bindsym $mod+Shift+Tab workspace prev

# move the currently focused window to the "scratchpad" window. this is an awkward key combo, but i3 should have launched a terminal
# in to the scratchpad already during login, so this isn't very important.
